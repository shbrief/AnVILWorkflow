Description: The AnVIL is a cloud computing resource developed in part
    by the National Human Genome Research Institute. The main cloud-based
    genomics platform deported by the AnVIL project is Terra. The 
    AnVILWorkflow package allows remote access to Terra implemented workflows,
    enabling end-user to utilize Terra/ AnVIL provided resources - such as
    data, workflows, and flexible/scalble computing resources - through the 
    conventional R functions.
